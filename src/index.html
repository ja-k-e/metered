    This is a musical composition with five patterns. 
    Each pattern is made up of two measures in different time signatures.
    The drum beat changes time signatures to highlight a specific pattern.
    This beat change occurs when the current pattern and the next pattern are in sync.
    The current pattern is played in a higher octave.
    The piece ends after 420 quarter notes, which is the first time that all patterns end a measure simultaneously.
    At a tempo of 140 bpm, this is precisely 3 minutes.

    You can see each pattern and its steps.
    Below it is an indication of which time signature it is in and how many times it has looped.
    If it is wide, it means the drums are currently playing in that time signature.
